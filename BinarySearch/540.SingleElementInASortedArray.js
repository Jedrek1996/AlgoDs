/*
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10

// Time Complexity: O(log n) — binary search skips matched pairs to find the odd one
// Space Complexity: O(1) — uses only index variables, no additional memory
var singleNonDuplicate = function(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);

        if (mid % 2 === 1) {
            mid--;
        }

        if (nums[mid] === nums[mid + 1]) {
            left = mid + 2;
        } else {
            right = mid;
